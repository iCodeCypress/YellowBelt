    <h4 style="background-color: blue;">history</h4>
    <p style="color: rgb(11, 68, 16);">Betta fish were first discovered in Southeast Asia, where they made their home in
        rice paddies, drainage ditches, and the warm flood plains of the region1. The fish became accustomed to frequent
        storm flooding and devastating droughts, which helped them to adapt and become a true labyrinth fish1. Betta
        keeping began in Thailand over 150 years ago, where children collected these territorial fish in rice paddies
        and would place them together to watch them spar, hence the name Siamese Fighting Fish2. The King of Siam
        recognized their popularity and decided to regulate and tax them2. Bettas were one of the first fish species to
        b</p>

    <h4 style="background-color: rgb(16, 88, 21);">Diet</h4>
    <p style="font-size: larger;">Betta fish are carnivores that eat insects and their larvae, as well as small
        crustaceans, worms, and fish. They have upturned mouths that allow them to catch prey on the water’s surface.
        Betta fish need a high-protein and varied diet. In captivity, they can be fed with different types of foods,
        such as worms, shrimps, flakes, pellets, and vegetables.</p>

    <h4 style="background-color: rgb(133, 209, 209);">habitat</h4>
    <p>Betta fish originated from Thailand but can be found in nearby countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, Vietnam,
        Laos, and Cambodia. Wild bettas live in shallow, freshwater areas such as rice paddies, stagnant ponds, marshes,
        and slow-moving streams. Being used to Asian climates, they prefer warm water around 80º Fahrenheit.</p>

    <h4 style="background-color: rgb(91, 109, 103);">care</h4>
    <p>The difference between female betta fish care and male betta fish care is very minimal. They both require the
        same water parameters, food, tank size, and decorations/plants. Males and females can require different types of
        care before, during and after breeding, but that’s more advanced than basic</p>

    <h4 style="background-color: aqua;">likes and dislikes</h4>
    <p>Betta fish are playful and curious fish that like to explore and interact with toys in their environment1. They
        can be taught tricks using toys such as ping pong balls and hoops. Bettas prefer slightly acidic and warm water,
        with a pH of 6.5 to 72. Cold water can suppress their immune system and cause illness. Bettas have several
        different tail shapes, with the most common being the "veil tail". They normally live 2-3 years, but there have
        been a few cases of bettas living well into their teens.</p>

    <h4 style="background-color: rgb(255, 204, 0);">beta fish</h4>
    <p>Beta fish are a large genus of small, colorful, freshwater fish in the gourami family1. The most popular and
        common beta fish is the Siamese fighting fish, which has beautiful fins and tails and is often kept as a pet.
        Beta fish are native to Asia, where they live in shallow water of marshes, ponds, or streams. Beta fish are
        diurnal and male bettas build bubble nests for their young and protect them from predators.</p>
