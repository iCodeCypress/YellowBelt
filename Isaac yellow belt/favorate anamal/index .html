<h4 style="text-align: center;background-color: chocolate;">history</h4>
<p> <b>Most cynologists believe the Poodle originated in Germany in the Middle Ages, from a dog similar to today's Standard Poodle. The Poodle was Germany's water dog, just as England had the English Water Spaniel, France the Barbet, Ireland the Irish Water Spaniel and the Netherlands the Wetterhoun. Among the evidence used to support this theory is the Germanic name for the breed, Poodle or "Pudel" in German, which is derived from the Low German word "puddeln", meaning "to splash".</b></p>

<h4 style="text-align: center; background-color: orange;">habitat</h4>
<p>They have a distinctive thick, curly coat that comes in many colors and patterns, with only solid colors recognized by breed registries. Poodles are active and intelligent, and are particularly able to learn from humans. Poodles tend to live 10–18 years, with smaller varieties tending to live longer than larger ones. See m</p>

<h4 style="text-align: center; background-color: coral;">care</h4>
<p>Walk your poodle daily for an hour or so. Toy and miniature poodles need walking just as much as the larger standard. If you have a standard poodle, also provide access to a securely enclosed yard or garden so he can exercise whenever he wishes. Smaller breeds can run around your home; larger ones need more space.

    Step 2
    Brush your pet once or twice <i> a</i> week, if his hair is clipped short. If some of the hair has been allowed to grow long, brush daily. Also, wipe the inside of his ears with a slightly damp cotton ball.
    
    Step 3
    Socialize your poodle by providing him with contact with other dogs and with people. This is especially important with a miniature or toy poodle, which might be shy and sensitive around strangers. Training classes can be a good way for him to interact with other dogs, as well as being helpful to you if you are new to dog care.
    
    Step 4
    Take him to a professional dog groomer for clipping every six weeks. Unless you show your poodle, it is best to get an all-over, short trim, which is the most comfortable for the dog and the easiest to groom.
    
    Step 5
    Take your dog for regular veterinary check-ups, especially important if he is a standard poodle. These large dogs are vulnerable to a number of serious problems, including gastric torsion and Addison’s disease, as well as earwax build-up. Your vet may recommend a series of tests</p>

<p>Many people have misconceptions about Poodles -- that they look and act like "sissy" dogs. That is one of the biggest myths in dogdom. First, ignore the silly show-ring clips. Poodles can be clipped into shorthaired, normal -looking dogs who are a snap to brush.</p>
