<h3>history</h3>
<p>The giraffes ancestors first appeared in central Asia about 15 million years ago, however, the earliest fossil records of the giraffe itself, from Israel and Africa, date back about 1.5 million years.</p>


<h3>diet</h3>
<p>Both in the wild and in captivity, giraffes show a preference for the leaves of the acacia tree. These trees have long thorns mixed in with the leaves that deter other animals, but giraffes are able to use their long tongues (measuring 18 to 20 inches) to maneuver around the thorns. Giraffes also have a built-in protection from their thorny meals: their thick, sticky saliva protects them from any thorns they may inadvertently swallow. While acacia leaves are a staple in their diet, they also eat the flowers when they are in season. The flowers have more tannin, but also twice the protein.</p>


<h3>habitat</h3>
<p>Giraffes are a common sight in grasslands and open woodlands in East Africa, where they can be seen in reserves such as Tanzania’s Serengeti National Park and Kenya’s Amboseli National Park. </p>


<h3>care</h3>
<p>They are the world’s tallest mammals. They are uniquely adapted to reach vegetation inaccessible to other herbivores. Unusually elastic blood vessels and uniquely adapted valves help offset the sudden buildup of blood (to prevent fainting) when giraffes’ heads are raised, lowered, or swung quickly. Their "horns" are actually knobs covered with skin and hair above the eyes that protect the head from injury. Their necks contain the same amount of vertebrae as we do (seven) except their bones are extremely elongated making their neck a long length of 2.4 meters.</p>


<h3>likes and dislikes</h3>
<p>Giraffes are the tallest mammals on Earth. Their legs alone are taller than many humans—about 6 feet.[1]
    They can run as fast as 35 miles an hour over short distances, or cruise at 10 mph over longer distances.[2]
    A giraffe's neck is too short to reach the ground. As a result, it has to awkwardly spread its front legs or kneel to reach the ground for a drink of water.[3]
    Giraffes only need to drink once every few days. Most of their water comes from all the plants they eat.[4]
    Giraffes spend most of their lives standing up; they even sleep and give birth standing up.[5]
    The giraffe calf can stand up and walk after about an hour and within a week, it starts to sample vegetation.[6]
    Despite the females’ attempts to stand over their calves during attacks by lions, spotted hyenas, leopards and African wild dogs (4), many calves are killed in their first few months.[7]
    A giraffe’s spots are much like human fingerprints. No two individual giraffes have exactly the same pattern.[8]
    Both male and female giraffes have two distinct, hair-covered horns called ossicones. Male giraffes use their horns to sometimes fight with other males.[9]
    Giraffes only need 5 to 30 minutes of sleep in a 24-hour period! They often achieve that in quick naps that may last only a minute or two at a time.[10]
    Whilst it was thought that giraffes did not make any sounds, this is now known to be untrue, as giraffes bellow, snort, hiss and make flute-like sounds, as well as low pitch noises beyond the range of human hearing.[11]
