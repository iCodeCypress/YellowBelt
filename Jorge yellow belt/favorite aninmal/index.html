<h3>History</h3>
<p>The lineage of the jaguar appears to have originated in Africa and spread to Eurasia 1.95â€“1.77 mya. The modern species may have descended from Panthera gombaszoegensis, which is thought to have entered the American continent via Beringia, the land bridge that once spanned the Bering Strait.</p>


<h3>diet</h3>
<p>They'll eat almost anything
    Jaguars are opportunistic hunters and can prey upon almost anything they come across. Capybaras, deer, tortoises, iguanas, armadillos, fish, birds and monkeys are just some of the prey that jaguars eat</p>
