<h3 style="color: darksalmon;">all about tigers</h3>

<h4>history</h4>
<p style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;"> Tiger, largest member of the cat family (Felidae), rivaled only by the lion in strength and ferocity. Males are larger than females and may attain a shoulder height of about 1 meter (about 3 feet) and a length of about 2.2 meters, excluding a tail of about 1 meter; weight is 160–230 kg (350–500 pounds).</p>


<h4>diet</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Tigers are carnivores, meaning they eat meat. Their natural prey includes wild pigs, buffalos, antelopes, and deer. They will also eat small animals like fish, snakes, monkeys, and rodents. Tigers mainly feed on deer and boar. It is unlikely for them to pick off other predators like bears because they fear bears’ threat.</p>


<h4>habitat</h4>
<p style="font-size: larger;">Habitat. Tigers live in a diverse array of habitats such as tropical rainforests, mangrove swamps, evergreen forests, grasslands, savannahs, and rocky areas.</p>

<h4>likes and dislikes</h4>
<p>
    Because Tigers are urgent people and always in a hurry to get things done right, they usually choose to operate alone. Tigers like to work, they are hard-working and dynamic. If you assign a task to a Tiger, the job will be undertaken and accomplished with enthusiasm and efficiency. Tigers make money, but they are not directly interested in money. Still, the Tiger needs not worry about money: just when he fears the money is gone, more seems to show up.
    Tigers are sensitive, emotional. They are capable of great love, but they become too intense about it. They are also territorial and possessive, if you are a friend of a Tiger, he wants you to take his side against the bad guys and because the Tiger is so adorable, you often do. As lovers, Tigers are passionate and romantic, but the real challenge for the Tiger is to grasp the true meaning of moderation.</p>


<h4>care</h4>
<p>Wild tigers’ habitat and prey numbers are declining. Conservationists are working to protect tiger habitat, find safe and healthy ways for tigers and humans to co-exist, ban and police tiger poaching, and monitor wild tiger populations and trends. But these problems can’t be solved overnight.</p>
