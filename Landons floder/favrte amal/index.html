<h4>History</h4>
<p>Genetic evidence suggests that dogs descended directly from wolves (Canis) and that the now-extinct wolf lineages that produced dogs branched off from the line that produced modern living wolves sometime between 27,000 and 40,000 years ago. The timing and location of dog domestication is a matter of debate.</p>

<h4>Diet</h4>
<p>hile meat makes up the majority of their diet, domestic dogs can also derive nutrients from grains, fruits, and vegetables. These non-meat foods are not simply fillers, but can be a valuable source of essential vitamins, minerals, and fiber. A good dog food will contain meat, vegetables, grains, and fruits.</p>


<h4>Habitat</h4>
<p>In the wild, dogs succeed in habitats that provide ample food, water and cover, like forests and brush lands. For shelter, some dogs will dig burrows, but most of the time they will use manmade cover or inhabit abandoned fox or coyote dens.</p>


<h4>Care</h4>
<p>Pets need healthy food. ...
    Give your pets 24/7 access to fresh drinking water. ...
    Proper pet care includes providing a safe, cozy shelter. ...

<h4>Like and Dislikes</h4>
<p>Dogs like collecting rophies, eating alone, always be your side, watching TV, and sleeping in bed. Dogs dislike rush walks, leaving them alone for too long, and overly strong scents. </p>
