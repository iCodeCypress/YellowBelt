<h3>History</h3>
<p id="para4"style="background-color: aqua;">Both the Pembroke and Cardigan Welsh Corgiare ancient breeds, possibly dating back to the 10th century (though many believe the Cardigan to be a bit older than the Pembroke), which began to disappear from Welsh farms by the early 1900s. In the 1850s, you could find Corgis on almost every farm in Wales" </p>

<p id="para5"style="font-family: 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">High-quality protein sources, such as turkey, chicken, beef, or lamb
    Nutrient-rich ingredients, including turkey liver, flaxseed, and salmon oil
    Wet food or canned food, which is very appetizing for most dogs
    Dry food or kibble, which should be high-quality and contain all the nutrients to promote a balanced diet
    Fresh water, which should be available at all times</p>

<h3>Habitat</h3>
<p id="para3">Welsh Corgis are domesticated dogs that thrive in hilly and mountainous areas12. They are natural herding dogs and are happiest on farms, but a roomy apartment with an outdoor space would be fine too3. The ideal habitat for this breed is one that offers plenty of space for playtime, regular walks, and outdoor activities such as running and chasing a ball or frisbee4. Typically, these dogs do better in cooler climates due to the thick fur coats that can make them overheat easily when exposed to heat for long periods of time4.</p>
