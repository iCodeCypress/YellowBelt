<h3>History</h3>
<p><b>Dog History</b> is the study of how dogs evolved from ancient canids, diverged from wolves, and became domesticated by humans12345. Dog history dates back to about 60 million years ago, when a small mammal called Miacis lived in Asia and gave rise to the first true dog, Cynodesmus, about 30 million years ago13. The dog's ancestor and modern wolves split between 40,000 and 30,000 years ago, before or during the Last Glacial Maximum2. There may have been two domestication events for dogs, one in East Eurasia and one in West Eurasia, that resulted in two distinct dog populations5. Dogs have been associated with humans ever since and have adapted to different environments and cultures</p>



<h3>Diet</h3>
<p><b>Dog Owners</b> are presented with an overwhelming array of options, all claiming to be the best dog food on the market. Wading through these choices to find a dog food brand that is healthy, affordable, and appealing to your pet is often frustrating. Weâ€™ve compiled expert advice to help you narrow down your options.Most people feed their dogs dry kibble or canned wet food. These processed foods might not be appealing to us, but they contain all of the nutrients dogs need to stay healthy.</p>


<h3>Habitat</h3>
<p
;">Dogs are highly adaptable creatures that can be found in various habitats across the world while domestic dogs share our homes, wild dogs adapt to diverse environments such as prairies, deserts, grasslands, forests, rainforests, coastal regions, and even arctic zones. Some breeds have evolved specific features like heavy coats to withstand freezing climates</p>

<h3>Likes and Dislikes</h3>
<p> <b>Personally</b>, My likes about dogs is they are a fun pet and good companion for kids and a family. But the breed of dog depends on how your family is. My dislikes about dogs is that they can be agressive and don't know how to calm down sometimes for different periods of times.</p>
