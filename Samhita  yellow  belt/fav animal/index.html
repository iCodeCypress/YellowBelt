<p>Scientifically tiger is known as “Panthera tigris”. Panthera is a genus given to animals that possess the ability to roar For example, Tiger, Lion, Jaguar, and Leopard. These animals have a free-floating hyoid bone in their throat which helps them to generate a roaring sound. However, as per new studies; the ability to roar is generated by the larynx commonly called the voice box. Recent genetic studies have included a Snow leopard in the genus Panthera though it doesn’t have the ability to roar.</p>

<p>Caring for tigers is very different from caring for other big cats, like lions. Where lions are social animals who prefer to live in groups, tigers are solitary. Tigers tend to be a little shyer and are not as open to social bonds. The only time tigers tolerate living together is when they are breeding.
