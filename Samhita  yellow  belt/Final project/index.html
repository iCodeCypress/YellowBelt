    <h3>land</h3>
    <p>Costa Rican Geography features nearly 1,300 km or 800 miles of tropical coastline. The Pacific Coastline is more
        mountainous and makes up about 80% of the coastal land. The Caribbean coast is a quarter of the size of the
        Pacific and features long stretches of sandy beaches. The Caribbean is highly humid with lower ocean tides and
        features swamps and mangroves. Along the Pacific Coastline there are high sheer cliffs rising majestically from
        turquoise lagoons, high tide variations, rainforest to the south and dry forest to the north. In fact, the
        Pacific Coast has two large, lush peninsulas reaching into the ocean. The Nicoya Peninsula is in the North and
        the Osa Peninsula is in the South. Osa is home to the abundant rainforest wilderness of Corcovado.</p>

    <h3>climate</h3>
    <p>The climate in Costa Rica, a Central American country extending from 8 to 11 degrees north latitude, is tropical,
        hot all year round, in the plains and along the coasts, while it's milder on the plateau, that is, in the
        so-called tierras templadas.</p>
    <h3>plant and animal life</h3>
    <p>Yes, the highland rainforests of Costa Rica are home to a diverse range of flora and fauna. The rainforests in
        Costa Rica are known for their high biodiversity, and many species of plants and animals can be found nowhere
        else 1. Some of the animals that inhabit the rainforests include jaguars, pumas, jaguarundis, margays, ocelots,
        oncillas, tapirs, three-toed sloths, anteaters, howler monkeys, white-throated capuchin monkeys, spider monkeys,
        squirrel monkeys, and various species of bats, birds, and amphibians 1. The rainforests are also home to a
        variety of plants, trees, vines, lianas, ferns, and flowers 2. The highland-mountain rainforests are
        predominantly made up of evergreen trees such as ancient oaks, and bamboo and moss are abundant 3. Hummingbirds
        are also common in these rainforests 3. I hope this helps!</p>
